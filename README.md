# Assignment-2 (Kok Siang, Hnin Thant)
We have decided to work on the ecommerce theme for soap products and have some ideas in mind. 

## Design Process
The colour theme was chosen to be on the lighter side as it matched the theme of soap. The products are displayed with enough spacing between each of them, providing a seamless and easy-to-use shopping experience, and effectively showcasing products. The shop would typically allow users to browse and purchase these products online, with the option to have the items shipped directly to their homes. 
The shop may also feature customer reviews and ratings, as well as detailed product descriptions and images to help customers make informed purchasing decisions. The shop may also offer special deals and promotions. Overall, an ecommerce shop that sells soap is a convenient and easy way for customers to purchase personal care products without having to leave their homes.

## Features
As a student, I would like to spend my time efficiently. Having an online website that is easily accessible at any time, from anywhere, without having to leave their homes can be especially useful for me as  my schedules are usually packed.

## Technologies Used

## Testing
The way we tested was that we tried out the actual website as a user. It was a form of trial and error. We ran the website again and again after every change to try and figure out what the problems in the codes were until we finally found the issue. And to fix the issue, we did more trials-and-errors. It was really a lot of experimentations.
